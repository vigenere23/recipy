# Recipy

Save your recipes in this beautiful reciope catalog!

## Installation

Make sure you have installed [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and run :

	yarn install
	yarn start

...and open your browser at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to launch the app!

## Known issues

- Should watch for max lengths
- Should remake the error system (maybe an object return from validator checks)

## Future

- A user system
- A database for storing recipes and users
- Recipes sorting (by date, cooking time, price, ingredients, etc.)
- A complete true MVC solution
- Who knows...
